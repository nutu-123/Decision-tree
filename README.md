# Decision-tree
In this mini project, I explored tree-based models using a Heart Disease dataset. The goal was to predict whether a person has heart disease based on various health-related features.
I trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized the decision-making process. To reduce overfitting, I limited the tree's depth and evaluated the modelâ€™s performance.

I also implemented a Random Forest Classifier and compared its accuracy with the decision tree. Additionally, I analyzed feature importances to understand which factors contribute most to heart disease prediction. Finally, I used cross-validation to ensure the model's performance is stable and reliable across different data splits.

Tools used: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
